Step 1: Setting Up The Data Streaming
Your source data is real-time taxi data, which you'll simulate using a Python script. Each taxi ride is a data point, and you're generating these data points continuously.

Python Script: Write a Python script that generates taxi ride data continuously. Each data point should include details like the start time, end time, start location, end location, distance, and fare.

Apache Kafka: Use Apache Kafka to handle this real-time data. Your Python script will publish data to a Kafka topic.

Step 2: Processing The Streaming Data
You'll process this data in real-time, calculating metrics like the current number of active rides and the average fare.

Apache Spark: Use Spark's Structured Streaming feature to consume the data from Kafka and calculate these real-time metrics.

Apache Atlas: As you're ingesting and processing this data, use Apache Atlas to catalog it. Each Kafka topic and Spark DataFrame should be registered in Atlas.

Step 3: Storing The Processed Data
Once you've calculated your real-time metrics, store them in a database for long-term storage and further analysis.

Hadoop (HDFS): Write the raw taxi ride data and the calculated metrics to HDFS for long-term storage.

Hive: Use Hive to create a schema on top of your HDFS data, making it easier to query.

Step 4: Batch Processing
In addition to the real-time processing, you'll also perform batch processing to calculate more complex metrics that can't be calculated in real-time.

Apache Airflow & dbt: Use Apache Airflow to schedule daily batch processing jobs. These jobs will use dbt to transform your HDFS data and calculate metrics like daily taxi usage and average daily fare per location.

Great Expectations: As part of your batch processing jobs, use Great Expectations to validate your data and ensure it's of high quality.

Step 5: Data Visualization
Finally, you'll visualize your data and metrics in a dashboard.

Power BI: Connect Power BI to your Hive tables and build a dashboard that shows your real-time and batch-processed metrics.
Step 6: Infrastructure As Code, CI/CD, and Monitoring
Throughout this project, you'll use best practices for infrastructure management, software development, and monitoring.

Docker & Kubernetes: Containerize your applications (like your Python script, Kafka, and Spark) using Docker, and manage them using Kubernetes.

Terraform: Use Terraform to manage your infrastructure as code. This includes your Kafka setup, your Hadoop cluster, and your Kubernetes cluster.

GitHub Actions: Use GitHub Actions to automate your software development process. This includes running tests on your code, building your Docker images, and deploying your Terraform infrastructure.

Grafana & Prometheus: Use Grafana and Prometheus to monitor your Kafka topics, your Spark streaming jobs, and your Airflow batch jobs.

ELK Stack: Use the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to manage and analyze logs from your applications.
